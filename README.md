pushing code done during class on 10-01-2022


had a difficult time navigating creating a new SSH key with a previous one existing, did a lot of youtubing and that was very helpful. 
Was able to create a SSH and properly push all changes made

I have found it challenging to follow along with the functinos/codes being created. I feel that when we are creating code together we should be 
given a minute to create our own function to get the answers we're looking for. 

ex) We created an array with all this info
    Instructor asks what function should we create to find largest dog in the array
    We should be given a minute to make our function
    Then we come back to give our answer of what that function could look like
    
    
 At least for me, I need a minute to think about what the next steps are.
 
 It's also very difficult to be typing while the instructor is explaining what we are doing, we should be given a minute to type then go into
 explaining parts of the function/codes we are creating and what they entail. 
 
 
 Overall this all has been super helpful and I have learned so much! Thank you Tan, your patience with us all is amazing. We can tell you really love what 
 you do and really want everyone to learn. I literally wouldn't have been able to learn any of this on my own and this class is putting me on the right
 path. See you in two weeks!
